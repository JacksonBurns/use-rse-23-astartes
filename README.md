# Extrapolation and Interpolation in Machine Learning Modeling with Fast Food and `astartes`

## Abstract
Machine learning is a groundbreaking tool for tackling high-dimensional datasets with complex correlations that humans struggle to comprehend.
An important nuance of ML is the difference between using a model for interpolation or extrapolation, meaning either inference or prediction.
This work will demonstrate visually what interpolation and extrapolation mean in the context of machine learning using `astartes`, a Python package that makes it easy to tackle in ML modeling.
Many different sampling approaches are made available with `astartes`, so using a very tangible dataset - a fast food menu - we can visualize how different approaches differ and then train and compare ML models.
